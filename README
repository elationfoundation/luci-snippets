Yasnippet LuCI snippets.

IN DEVELOPMENT!!!

See http://luci.subsignal.org/trac/wiki/Documentation for full LuCI documentation.


The LuCI CBI library has many undocumented features. During my last development push one of my coworkers suggested I put some of my extensive notes into snippets so that they would be able to see the possible options available to them at a glance.

This is a incomplete (and occationaly erronious) set of snippets that I am working on to help new LuCI developers make the most of the robust, but undocumented, code base. Please be careful to read over the finalized code produced by these snippets as it is still in development, and the occational extra or missing quote or paren is not out of the question.

TODO:

 * There are a lot of options that are available, but not useful except for edge cases. Possibly remove them or reorganize them to better support development.

 * These snippets need to be terse enough to not lead new users off of crazy edge cases, but in-depth enough to encourage problem solving and code spelunking to find the right solution before giving up and creating their own code heavy templates.
